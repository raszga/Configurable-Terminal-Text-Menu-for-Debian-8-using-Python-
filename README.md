# Configurable-Terminal-Text-Menu-for-Debian-8-using-Python-
It happened quite few times that I needed to present data in the text terminal accessible under Debian 8 Linux Dist.

The data broadcast in the terminal has the advantage of being free from the IDLE  and being able to run the Python program as a system command 

Story short after I searched the Internet I decided to try to build my own version which is a "copy" of an old menu program I wrote in Turbo Pascal 7 under MS.DOS

As you would expect even if I like and use Python (2.7)  my  Pascal experience makes the code slightly more conventional...
